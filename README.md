# Application created to track inpost parcels.

#### Mostly created to show and expand my swift skills. 
Check almost the same app created in objective-c with storyboards here: https://github.com/qyzdo/inpost

# Main features: 
##### • Written in Swift
##### • UI 100% programatically without storyboards (basic UI just to display data, without fancy stuff)
##### • Cocoapods
##### • Networking with URLSession in separate file
##### • Onboarding screen on first application launch with Lottie Animations
##### • Table view with custom cells
##### • Navigation controller
